# BudgetCalendar

BudgetCalendar is a Full-stack project built using Angular 16 and .Net to showcase various skills in Web App Development. Though early days, the Back-end is functional through the usage of simple Rest API calls and a User authentication system using JWT tokens and .Net Identity.

Project can be seen working by running `ng serve` from within the BudgetTracker.Client folder and starting the .net server https in Visual Studio.

Below are some screenshots of the current state of the app. **Updated: 04/07/2023**
